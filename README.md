## Christoffer Granstedt - Portfolio site

This site, "christoffergranstedt.com", is my own portfolio site. The site is is built with NextJS and make use of its possibilities to generate static pages. It uses TypeScript instead of ordinary JavaScript. Cosmic JS as a headless CMS is used to store different projects and skills for manage flexibility. Tailwind CSS is used for the styling.
