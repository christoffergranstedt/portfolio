## Christoffer Granstedt - Portfolio site

This site, "christoffergranstedt.com", is my portfolio site. The site is built with NextJS and makes use of its possibilities to generate static pages. It uses TypeScript instead of ordinary JavaScript. Cosmic JS is used as a headless CMS to store different projects and skills for management flexibility. Tailwind CSS is used for the styling.
